The Cash Flow & Cashback Summary table renders correctly below the property charts.
The "Reinvest to Stock" button is only shown when hasUserCalculated is true (i.e., after user clicks Calculate).
The default calculation on mount does NOT set hasUserCalculated, so the button won't appear until user clicks Calculate.
This is intentional - user must explicitly calculate before seeing the reinvest button.

Need to click "Calculate My Property Plan" to see the Reinvest to Stock button.
